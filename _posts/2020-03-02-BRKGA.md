title: An introduction to the BRKGA Algorithm
---

I recently performed a study on a brand new evolutionary algorithm called BRKGA-MP-IPR (what big name, I know). This article aims to explain a little on what the algorithm consists of, its main features and novelties, and some examples of problems it was tested on.

## What does this longs name even means? TL;DR
###### Let's break it into three pieces, so we can get it more easily.
Firstly, BRKGA stands for *Biased random key genetic algorithm*, this is simply a branch of the classical *genetic algorithm* (GA for short). Secondly, MP stands for *Multi parenting* which is just a technique for individuals selection (we'll explain this later on) and finally, IPR stands for *Implicit Path Relink*, a novel version of the *Path relink* local search method, commonly used to enhance solutions found by heuristics by combining them.

## Understanding the core concepts
In order to see the big picture of BRKGA-MP-IPR more clearly, we need to understand the core concepts the algorithm relies on, and these are:
- Genetic Algorithm;
- Biased Random Keys;
- Multi Parenting;
- Path Relink;

## 1- Genetic Algorithms
Genetic algorithms (GAs) are a family of metaheuristics deeply inspired by the theory of natural evolution. GAs are implemented so they reflect various processes of natural selection such as the survival of the fittest individuals, breeding, mutation and of course the evolution of individuals. Common usages of GAs include global optimization and scheduling problems, even though since its initial development numerous variations of GAs were crafted to fit a very wide field of real-world problems ([see the list here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genetic_algorithm_applications)).

In terms of code, the simplest versions of GAs are simple to understand. I'm linking here [the most relevant implementations listed by Github](https://github.com/search?l=Python&q=simple+genetic+algorithm&type=Repositories) if you want to explore how it looks in real code.

## 2- Biased Random Keys
To represent a candidate solution for a problem, a GA encodes a solution in the form of an individual. The simplest example of this might be a population of individuals that can be decoded to solutions for a TSP ([Traveling Salesperson Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)) instance. Below there's an exampÄºe of such a representation:

```python

# represents a possible solution as a list of numbers
individual = [1,2,3,4,5]
# store this individual in the population
population[index] = individual

```
In this example, the variable *individual* stores the order in which cities are visited on the salesperson tour, and like this, each number is a graph edge.

Now we can easily notice that during breeding and mutation some of the offspring individuals could possibly be not valid re
